This is my final project for CS 2048. the project is an initial demo of the idea Dairy One app.
It use the camera, so you have to run on actual iOS devices instead of simulator.
Xcode 9 and ios 11.0 is needed to run the program. If any problem to run the program, send email to me (hz463@cornell.edu)
It uses an third party library 'JTAppleCalendar' to make some functions of Calendar.So Open it in workspace.

Following I would show how each requirement is satisfied:
1 there are multiple view controllers(including cameraViewController,photoViewController,...)
2 there are tab bar controller and navigation controller
3 photoDB is the shared model to store the basic infomation of the dairy
4 there is an progressView to count the number of dairy with progress bar, hhere is use drawRect
5 AutoLayout is used.
6 there is one animation: when you click the button of custom camera, the button would change color, this is added by animation

I would work on adding more features and make a much more complete version on Dairy One, welcome any advice.
